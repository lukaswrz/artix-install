# artix-install

A quick & easy installation script for [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/)
with [runit](https://wiki.artixlinux.org/Main/Runit).

## Usage

The settings in the graphical menu from the Artix ISO will be used and applied
to the new installation, so make sure that you entered them correctly.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukaswrz/artix-install/main/artix-install.bash
bash artix-install.bash
```

## Note

This will only create a basic install without any sort of graphical environment.
